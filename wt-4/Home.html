            attributed to the panch kalyanakas of various Jain tirthankaras.

            “mystic space-time” of the mountain range, with the presence and
            turnover of different sects of Sadhu Babas, Nath sect and others.

            Girnar. It hosts a number of temples and some historical spots
            across its range. Amidst the lush green Gir Forest, the mountain
            range serves as the hub of religious activity.
